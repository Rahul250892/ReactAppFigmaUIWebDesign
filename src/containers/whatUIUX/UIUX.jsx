       The “UI” in UI design stands for “user interface.” The user interface is the graphical layout of an application. It consists of the buttons users click on, the text they read, the images, sliders, text entry fields, and all the rest of the items the user interacts with. This includes screen layout, transitions, interface animations and every single micro-interaction. Any sort of visual element, interaction, or animation must all be designed. 
       User interface design or user interface engineering is the design of user interfaces for machines and software, such as computers,
       home appliances, mobile devices, and other electronic devices, with the focus on maximizing usability and the user."/>
